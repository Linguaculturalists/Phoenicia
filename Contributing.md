## License

Phoenicia is provided under the [GPLv3](COPYING) open source license. It makes use of some [dependencies](README.md#dependencies) that are provided under other compatible open source license.

## X-Prize

Phoenicia is being developed as part of the [Global Learning XPRIZE](http://learning.xprize.org/) competition. While the code is being developed in the open, under the GPLv3 license, the XPRIZE rules require that finalists be released under the APL. Because of this, contributors must sign a CLA which will allow for that re-licensing in the event that Phoenicia is chosen as a finalist.


## Contributor Agreement

Before you send your first contribution to Phoenicia, we will need to you sign the contributor agreement that will allow us to re-license your contribution under the Apache Public License 2.0 as required by the XPRIZE.

We are using a CLA from the [Harmony Agreements](http://www.harmonyagreements.org/about.html) project. Much like the Creative Commons licenses, these agreements have been designed to be both beneficial to those that use them as well as legally supportable.

To sign the agreement, simple put your name and the email address you use in your git commits to the bottom of one of the Harmony CLA files. If you are contributing as an individual, add your name and email address to [Harmony_CLA_Individual](Harmony_CLA_Individual.md). If you are contributing as a company or non-profit, add your name, your company name, and email to [Harmony_CLA_Entity](Harmony_CLA_Entity.md)

Contributions being made to one of Phoenicia's dependencies will not be subject to this agreement, but should follow the contribution requirements for those projects.
